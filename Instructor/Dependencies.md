# Dependencies

All labs are dependent on the successfull completion of Practice [Setup](/Instructions/Practices/Setup.md).

This installs catch-up scripts in C:\LabResources\Solutions. If a lab or practice is dependent on a previous lab or practice, it is mentioned in the setup section, including the script, if available.

The labs are structured in a way, that the most important exercises come first. Therefore, students may leave out later exercises, if they are running out of time or are not interested. However, **students must not skip exercises or tasks within a lab**.
