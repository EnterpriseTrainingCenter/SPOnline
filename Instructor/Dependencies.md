# Dependencies

There is one dependency in all labs:

Students have to complete the setup and exercises 1 and 2 of the lab [Get started with SharePoint](/Instructions/Labs/Get-started-with-SharePoint-administration.md)

Aside from this dependeny, all labs are independent from each other. Moreover, the labs are structured in a way, that the most important exercises come first. Therefore, students may leave out later exercises, if they are running out of time or are not interested. However, **students must not skip exercises or tasks within a lab**.
